Dimensions
==========

Dimensions is a pure Ruby library for reading the width, height and
rotation angle of GIF, PNG, JPEG and TIFF images.

Use the `dimensions`, `width` and `height` methods on the `Dimensions`
module to measure image files:

```ruby
require 'dimensions'

Dimensions.dimensions("upload_bird.jpg")  # => [300, 225]
Dimensions.width("upload_bird.jpg")       # => 300
Dimensions.height("upload_bird.jpg")      # => 225
```

Use the `type` method to get image type:

```ruby
Dimensions.type("upload_bird.jpg")        # => :jpeg
Dimensions.type("wrong_ext.txt")          # => :png
```

Many cameras and smartphones set the EXIF orientation attribute for
photos taken in portrait or landscape mode. The Dimensions library
reads this attribute and swaps the `width` and `height` values
automatically to accurately reflect how the image looks when
rotated. You can use the `angle` method to check a JPEG image's
orientation in degrees:

```ruby
Dimensions.angle("upload_bird.jpg")       # => 0
Dimensions.angle("rotated.jpg")           # => 90
```

### Reading dimensions from a stream

Pass an IO object to the `Dimensions` method to extend it with the
`Dimensions::IO` module and transparently detect its dimensions and
orientation as it is read. Once the IO has been sufficiently read, its
`width`, `height` and `angle` methods will return non-nil values
(assuming its contents are an image).

```ruby
require 'dimensions'
require 'json'
require 'securerandom'

module Uploader
  def self.call(env)
    body = Dimensions(env["rack.input"])

    # Handle the upload
    token = SecureRandom.hex(20)
    path  = File.join(UPLOAD_PATH, token)
    File.open(path, "wb") { |file| file.write body.read }

    # Return the width and height as JSON
    [
      200,
      {"Content-Type" => "application/json"},
      [JSON.dump(
        "token"  => token,
        "width"  => body.width,
        "height" => body.height
      )]
    ]
  end
end
```

### Version History

**1.3.0** (November 26, 2013)

* Added support for calling `#dimensions` on a Dimensions-extended
  rewindable IO without first calling `#read`.

**1.2.0** (April 25, 2012)

* Added support for measuring the dimensions of TIFF images.

**1.1.0** (April 1, 2012)

* Fixed an issue where images with certain invalid orientation values
  would be improperly treated as having an angle of 270 degrees.
* Eliminated a message when loading Dimensions with warnings enabled.

**1.0.0** (July 1, 2011)

* Initial release.
